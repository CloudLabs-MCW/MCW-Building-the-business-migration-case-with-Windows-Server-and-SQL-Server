## Exercise 3: Azure Arc-enable on-premises VM

Duration: 45 minutes

In this exercise, you will Azure Arc-enable a Windows Server VM that Tailspin has on-premises. This VM is being Arc-enabled since there are no plans to migrate it to Azure, but Tailspin would like to simplify the management of all their VMs in a single place. Azure Arc provides the functionality to manage Azure and on-premises VMs in a single place giving Tailspin Toys exactly what they are looking for to simplify VM management and administration.

    > - Install KB2919355 from <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=42334>
    >
    > Be sure to restart the VM after installing the updates, before you continue with the .NET Framework install.
    >
    > ![The blocking issue warning of the .NET Framework installer is shown with the message for the blocking issue highlighted.](images/dot-net-framwork-blocking-issue.png "Blocking issue warning with message highlighted")
    - Once the **.NET Framework** is installed on **Download and Install Updates** click on **Restart Now**.
    
     ![download the Windows Update for installing .NET Framework .](images/Ex3-T2-S7.2.png ".NET Framework")

9. Within the **OnPremVM**, open the **Windows PowerShell ISE**, and create a new script file.

10. Paste in the contents of the Azure Arc `OnboardingScript.ps1` script that was previously downloaded.

    > **Note**: Within the Hyper-V Virtual Machine Connection window, you may need to use the **Clipboard** -> **Type clipboard text** menu option to paste into the **OnPremVM**.
     
     ![Run OnboardingScript.ps1 script .](images/Ex3-T2-S10.png "OnboardingScript.ps1")

11. Run the full script. This will install the Azure Arc agent and Arc-enable the VM. When the script opens up a browser window, enter your credentials to authenticate with Azure.

    > **Note**: When the Azure Arc script opens a new browser window to authenticate you with Azure, be sure to use an Organization Account with permissions to create `Microsoft.HybridCompute/machines` resources. Using a Personal Account is not supported and will result in a `AZCM0042: Failed to Create Resource` error message.
    
    ![Azure credentials login .](images/Ex3-T2-S11.png "Azure credentials")
    
    ![Azure credentials login .](images/Ex3-T2-S11.1.png "Azure credentials")

12. When the script finishes executing successfully, a message stating "**Connected machine to Azure**" will be shown, along with the Azure Portal resource URL for the Azure Arc-enabled Server.

    ![The command line output of the Azure Arc script is shown that includes the Connected machine to Azure message showing the script executed successfully.](images/Ex3-T2-S12.png "Azure Arc script successful with Connected machine to Azure message")

### Task 3: Verify Azure Arc-enabled VM

1. In the Azure Portal, navigate to the Resource Group for the lab. Scroll down and locate the Azure resource of type **Server - Azure Arc** and select it.

    ![The tailspin-rg Resource group for the lab is shown in the Azure Portal.](images/Ex3-T3-S1.png "tailspin-rg resource group")

    > **Note**: The on-premises VM has been Azure Arc-enabled and can be managed alongside other Azure resources. This is enabled by the **Azure Connected Machine Agent** running on the VM that facilitates the interaction between Azure and the Azure Arc-enabled VM.

2. This is the **Server - Azure Arc** pane for the on-premises virtual machine that was just Azure Arc-enabled. The **Status** shows **Connected** to signify that the Azure Arc-enabled virtual machine is connected to Azure. Also, notice that the **Computer Name** and **Operating System** of the virtual machine are displayed.

    ![The Server - Azure Arc pane in the Azure Portal is shown for the on-premises VM with status, computer name, and operating system values highlighted within the Essentials section.](images/Ex3-T3-S2.png "Azure Portal Server - Azure Arc pane for Azure Arc-enabled virtual machine")

3. From here, there are several **Azure Arc** capabilities available to use for managing the Azure Arc-enabled virtual machine.

    ![The Capabilities section of the Server- Azure Arc pane is shown with the list of capabilities to choose from.](images/Ex3-T3-S3.png "Azure Arc capabilities listed on the Server - Azure Arc pane")

4. Select **Extensions** under **Settings**. This is where you can install Extensions on the Azure Arc-enabled virtual machine. For example, the **Custom Script Extension for Windows - Azure Arc** extension can be used to download PowerShell scripts and files from Azure storage, and launch a PowerShell script on the machine.

    ![The Extensions pane for the Server - Azure Arc resource is shown with the Extensions link under Settings highlighted.](images/Ex3-T3-S4.png "Azure Portal Server - Azure Arc pane showing Extensions")
