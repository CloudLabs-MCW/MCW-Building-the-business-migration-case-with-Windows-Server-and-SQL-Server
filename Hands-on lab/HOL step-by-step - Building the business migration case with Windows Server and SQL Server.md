# Building the business migration case with Windows Server and SQL Server hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you will perform steps to migrate Windows Server and SQL Server workloads to Azure. You will go through provisioning a Windows Server VM, migrating a SQL Server database to Azure SQL Managed Instance (SQL MI), and Azure Arc-enable an on-premises Windows Server VM.

## Overview

In this lab, attendees will perform steps toward migrating Tailspin Toy's on-premises Windows Server and SQL Server workloads to Azure. Tailspin needs a new Windows Server VM created in Azure for hosting their Web application, an on-premises SQL Server database migrated to Azure SQL Managed Instance, and an on-premises Windows Server VM to be Azure Arc-enabled.

Tailspin already has a Hub and Spoke network setup in Azure with Azure Bastion for enabling remote management of Azure VM using Azure Bastion. The Azure resources provisioned throughout this lab will be deployed into this environment.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be better able to set up a Windows Server for application migration to Azure, migrate an on-premises SQL Database to Azure SQL Managed Instance, and Azure Arc-enable an on-premises virtual machine so it can be managed from Azure.

## Solution architecture
